# Amazon Product Analysis using NumPy and Pandas

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon product data to understand customer satisfaction, pricing patterns, discount behavior, and category-level performance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Business-driven analysis
- Insight generation

## Key Insights
- Most products have high customer ratings, indicating strong overall satisfaction.
- Discounted prices vary widely, covering both budget and premium segments.
- Very high discounts do not necessarily lead to better ratings.
- Certain categories such as Computers & Accessories (Tablets) perform better in terms of ratings.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that customer satisfaction is influenced more by product quality and category than by heavy discounts. These insights can help businesses optimize pricing and product strategy.
